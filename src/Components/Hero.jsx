            An engineer who makes ideas real faster than deadlines can blink.By
            day I build applications from the ground up using React, Node,
            PostgreSQL, and AWS, and I‚Äôve scaled data-intensive, full-stack
            applications to improve data retrieval by 35% while shipping 15+
            product features in six months. By night, I wonder why semicolons
            choose the worst possible moments to disappear.
            <br /> As an AWS Certified Solutions Architect, I‚Äôm not just writing
            code I‚Äôm designing systems that stay reliable when traffic spikes,
            scale as businesses grow, and refuse to break even when you look at
            them funny. My toolkit includes automation, performance tuning, and
            the occasional motivational pep talk to stubborn APIs. I lean toward
            frontend and design because code is my craft, but design is where
            the artist in me comes alive.
            <br /> To me, software engineering isn‚Äôt just about shipping
            features; it‚Äôs about creating experiences. That‚Äôs why I love adding
            polish with subtle CSS animations, automating pipelines that save
            hours, and mentoring others so they don‚Äôt repeat the mistakes I
            definitely didn‚Äôt make (well, maybe once or twice).
            <br />
            Outside of work, you‚Äôll find me debating what to order, geeking out
            as a cinema buff, or tinkering with side projects to keep my
            curiosity sharp. <br /> Have a look at my resume to see my technical
            qualifications in detail.
